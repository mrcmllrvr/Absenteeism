# Absenteeism
Data science project from 365's The Data Science Course 2023: Complete Data Science Bootcamp on Coursera


This project aims to predict employee absenteeism by analyzing various characteristics to determine if an employee is likely to be absent from work. Factors such as distance from the workplace, number of dependents, and level of education will be considered.

Absenteeism is defined as "the absence from work during regular working hours due to temporary incapacity to perform regular work activities". The competitive business environment and associated pressures can contribute to increased stress levels and potential health issues among employees, including minor illnesses or even long-term conditions like depression.

However, this project focuses on the perspective of the company's person in charge of productivity rather than individual's well-being. The goal is to predict absenteeism and answer important questions such as whether an employee is expected to be absent for a specific number of hours, the relevant information for making such predictions, and whether excessive absenteeism can be anticipated.

By obtaining such insights, the company can make informed decisions to optimize work processes, maintain productivity, and enhance the overall quality of work generated within the organization.
